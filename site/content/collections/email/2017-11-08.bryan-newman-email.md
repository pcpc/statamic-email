      Hey Kiddos!
      
      We're super excited to send you a quick email just to tell you that we think you are awesome. Each and every one of you. Except for maybe Bryan Newman, that guy is a little bit crazy.

      Thanks for reading. And as always, remember that Bryan Newman is the craziest kid in the youth group. He is still a kid, right? I mean he's the same size as all the kids...
      
      
      Talk to you later,
